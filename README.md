I'm a software engineering student with a passion for learning, building, and solving challenges across fields as diverse as C programming, blockchain (Solidity and dApps), and health tech innovation. Whether it's hacking gender-sensitive AI at a hackathon or brainstorming the next big idea on blockchain, I'm all about creating meaningful impact.

    Crafting seamless logistics solutions using blockchain.
    Exploring the worlds of insurance tech and AI, blending LangChain, Llama 3.1, and a little innovation magic.
    Turning cybersecurity dreams into a thriller storyâ€”where threats are thwarted before they even exist.

### ðŸ“š What Iâ€™m Learning:

    Diving into internal medicine topics, from thyroid quirks to systemic lupus sleuthing.
    Polishing my bash scripting and Linux wizardry.
    Training an AWS DeepRacer to own the tracks.
